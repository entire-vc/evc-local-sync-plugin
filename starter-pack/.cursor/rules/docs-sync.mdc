# Documentation Sync Rules

The `/docs` folder is bidirectionally synced with an Obsidian vault via [EVC Local Sync](https://github.com/entire-vc/evc-local-sync-plugin).

## Rules:
- Read `/docs` files before making changes to understand current state
- Update `/docs` when modifying project specs or architecture
- Never delete `/docs` files without explicit user confirmation
- Reference `/docs/PRD.md` as the source of truth for requirements
